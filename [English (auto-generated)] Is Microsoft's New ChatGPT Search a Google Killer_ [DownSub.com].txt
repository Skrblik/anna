alphabet or AKA Google share price is down eight percent in the last two days because there's a panic in the market there's a perception that Microsoft's new AI driven search engine and browser is gonna disrupt Google's market share gonna kill their business so how much of a threat does Microsoft's Bing search engine really post to Google let's find out more in this video [Music] now I own both Microsoft as well as Google or alphabet in my portfolio in fact I've got more Microsoft shares than Google Shares so I'm kind of like a father who has got two children that I love very much I love them equally and they're both competing on who's getting the better grades so in other words you know whoever wins I win so because I love both stocks equally as much let me give my pure unbiased opinion on whether I think one of my children Microsoft is gonna take away the launch of my other child Google so this whole War started when Microsoft announced that they were going to integrate chat GPT into their search engine being in as well as their browser which is called age and for those of you who have been playing with chat gbt know how revolutionary it can be in the whole search process it's like having a personal virtual assistant that can give you a customized single answer you can ask ask you to write a poem for you write an essay create a piece of code write an itinerary for crypto is pretty amazing stuff now the thing about AI is that Google is actually the one that's been investing in the AI for the last 10 years it's way ahead of AI but Microsoft has now created the perception that it has jumped ahead because it announced that it's integrating this AI chatbot into its search and web browser now bear might is not fully integrated it's just a demo version and of course Google didn't want to look like it was losing out so Google quickly said we are going to have our own AI chatbot as well they call it Bart and they rushed out an advertisement showing how bad AI could be integrated into a search now Google already had this technology for many many years but they do want to release it yet because they wanted to be sure that they didn't want to rush things but because Microsoft came out first now they had to rush to show that we are also in the game but unfortunately during the that demo and advertisement that Google did their chatbot made uh kind of like a mistake but the one new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my nine-year-old about so Bart which is Google's AI came up with three answers and the third answer was actually factually wrong now first you got to understand that chat GPT owned by Microsoft also has a lot of Errors a lot of mistakes as well so this is not something different um but people's perception is that or Google is supposed to be ahead it's a leader it's reliable so they're kind of like got people to panic like you know your chatbot is not that much better than Microsoft's chatbot so that was the first uh problem the second issue was that the CEO of Microsoft Satya nandella I call him Nutella right so Nutella came out and he said that he was very confident that with this new AI infused chat and browser that Microsoft was going to take away market share from Google's search business and because search is what a big part of Google's business uh investors panicked now it's important to bear in mind that Microsoft has actually been trying to take away Google search business for 10 years using their Bing search engine so this is not something new but what Nutella is now saying is that because of their AI driven search they're able to now have a strong competitive advantage to take away market share from Google and lower their profit margin so the combination of Nutella speech plus Google's blunder is what made investors panic and send the share price down eight percent in two days as an investor you have to do your research and look at the facts to ask this question is Google share price drop and overreaction is it just an emotional overreaction or does Microsoft really have a chance of taking a significant market share away from Google's search business so let's find out more right now so the first thing is to look at what's the current market share of search in the market so as of 2022 Google has a 92 percent market share of global search uh in second place is Bing owned by Microsoft and you've got Yahoo 1.23 Yandex uh by 2 from China and go which I've never really heard of right by point six percent so for many many years all again all the other search engines especially Yahoo and and Bing they have been attempting to take away market share from Google for for years and years and years they've not been being able to do so so the question is Now with uh AI chat infused into their search engines do they have a chance now why is it in the last 10 years competitors have not been able to take market share away from Google that much because Google has what we call a sustainable competitive advantage or economic mode that protects them from all this competition so what are the sources of Google's mode and with uh AI Can Microsoft Bing or other search engines disrupt Google's economic mode source so first we have to understand what's their mode Source there are five sources of their mode that gives them again this competitive advantage first is the art brand Monopoly simply what we call top of Mind recall we'll go into that more in a while number two their default position at the browser level number three their default position at the hardware and operating system level number four the quality of their search results and finally the Google ecosystem so what do I mean so the first major advantage that Google has is what we call top of Mind recall when you think of search the first thing you think about if you're like most people is Google in fact Google has become a verb it's become part of our vocabulary we don't say go search for this we say go Google this go Google there the same way when we think of cola Coca-Cola as the top of Mind recall when we think of you know sportswear it's like Nike when we think about you know Burgers and Fries it's McDonald's it's just top of Mind recall so will there be a day when you say go Bing this go Bing that right I don't know leave your comments in the comment section so if if Google as a brand is you know pop of mine recall in billions of people around the world it's a habit that's going to be a bit hard to change and as long as people have Google at the top of the Mind recall it gives them that significant competitive advantage against all other search engines a survey um from Survey Monkey found that most consumers prefer any search results that have the Google label on top of the results even if they are actually the search results put by Bing oh poor thing when given a choice between Bing search results and that are labeled as Google and Google search results labeled as Bing respondents chose the Google labeled results by a ratio of two is to one the study concludes that consumers are simply biased towards Google as a result of the brand which being which has been a major reason that Bing has not yet made significant inroads against it so really that's the part of the brand so sometimes even if another phone may be better in terms of features but we still prefer an Apple phone even though another sport shoe could be of better quality but we prefer Nike shoes it's because we have emotional associations to to Brands so that's the first Advantage that Google has now what's interesting is that they found that when people search using Bing the Bing search engine what were their top 10 searches on Bing right number one was a search for Facebook number two they searched for YouTube which is owned by Google alphabet number three they search for Google number four they search for Gmail right and they search for Bing homepage quiz so you can see that even when they use Bing among the top five search results YouTube Google and Gmail come out on their on their search preferences so that's something pretty interesting now the second source of Google's competitive Advantage is that Google happens to be the default search engine for most browsers that people use so globally 65 of people use the Chrome browser and chrome is owned by Google that's right so this is on my Google 18 of people use Safari browser and Safari is owned by Apple um four percent four point four percent is are using the age browser which is uh by Microsoft Firefox three percent Samsung internet 2.61 and Opera 2.4 percent yeah so what's interesting is you can see that uh for the Chrome browser Chrome Safari Firefox Samsung and Opera one two three four five out of the five browsers they are default setting is directed to Google search engine now of course people can always choose can always change the default search engine but the default is towards Google and that's why Google has a 92 percent market share simply because the majority of browsers are set to Google at default and the only browser that is not set to Google is of course H because H is owned by Microsoft so they will set the default of age to of course their own bin search engine so for Microsoft Bing to significantly take market share from Google they have to convince the browsers to change to Bing at the default position so can they convince Chrome to do it no because Chrome is owned by Google so obviously they're not going to do that right how about Safari so far is owned by Apple so uh will Apple change to Bing instead of Google uh I don't think so because right now Google is paying Apple 15 to 20 billion dollars a year to put Google as their default search engine so unless Nutella can seduce Tim Cook come on baby point it to me man you know then well it could happen you never know right but until that happens Safari and chrome together make a big percentage of browsers and they all point to Google so that's the second Advantage now the third competitive advantage that Google has is that again Google is set at the default position at the hardware and operating system level that means it's built into your your mobile phone all right now so Google has a default positioning at the hardware and operating system level on the majority of mobile devices Bing's shares negligible as of current So currently in a smartphone market you can see that Apple has a 20 market share Samsung has a 20 market share so together they make up the majority market share of smartphone uh users right now Apple again was their default browser it's Safari which is owned by Apple and Safari's default search engine is Google why because again um Google is paying Apple 15 billion dollars to make them their default search engine so again like I said unless Nutella can convince Tim Cook to switch alliances uh this would be a huge Advantage towards Google Now some songs default browser is Chrome which is owned by Google so that also points to Google now the rest let's take a look xiaomi which is the Chinese brand their default browser is their own me browser and default setting is to Google outside China within China is by two for Oppo uh default browser is Chrome so points to Google as well Huawei uh default browser is their own Huawei browser and their default search engine is that's right petal I never knew there was a search engine called petal but there is and it's owned by Huawei uh finally Vivo so Vivo has got their own Vivo browser and that points to Google as well in the outside China and within China is by two so again you can see that in terms of the hardware and operating system majority still points to Google and for Nutella to disrupt Google they he has to be able to convince all of them Samsung Apple uh xiaomi Oppo to to switch alliances and that's not going to be easy Google's fourth competitive Advantage is of course the quality of its search results the fact that Google search results have the most irrelevance and the most reliability and has got the widest uh quantity of search for users so again uh how good an AI chat bot is really depends on the data it is trained with so sure uh you know Bing could launch the first AI chat but if it's the quality of his data is not as rich as Google in the long run it can't compete with Google's chatbot once they sort out the the Kings right so studies from Google and Microsoft and academics have generally suggested that Google search product is just simply better that's why most of us use Google because we get the best search results you can see that numerous Studies have confirmed this Google has outscored Bing in each test in the US uh the Gap stood stood at 8.1 percentage points uh even in the UK Google outscored Bing in each test the Gap stood at 10 percentage points now the quality of a search engines results is also down to what we call the web crawlers they've got web crawlers that go onto the internet and they search for all these pages and they compile the search results so you can see that the Google bot is the default in on this chart and you can see the relative access to sites for the different types of boards being bought is slightly below all right they're slightly below Google uh by two spider is you know way below bingbot dart board is over there Apple bought yandexboard and so and so forth so we can see that uh bing bot is close to Google bot but is still trailing by a a margin over there the fifth competitive advantage that Google has over other search engines is the Google ecosystem that is beyond just searching for information so the Google ecosystem as you know consists of Google Maps which are the best maps in the world better than Apple Maps better than Bing Maps and no matter how much money Apple tried to put into the Apple Maps they just couldn't um compete with Google Maps so even though I'm an Apple iPhone user but I don't use Apple Maps I use Google Maps and so do a lot of other people I got Google Calendar the fact that Google Chrome stores your saved passwords and your payment uh data right so once your passwords are saved your payment data is safe on say Chrome you know it's very inconvenient to change to another browser to change into another search engine so that creates that that switching course that causes users to stick to chrome stick to Safari and then stick to Google so again the Google ecosystem which is beyond search is integrated into search results it's a big part of Google's mode and a significant portion of Google searches as high as 46 have local intention so for example if I'm from Singapore and I'm searching for let's say I type in coffee on uh on Google you'll even show me where I can buy coffee around my area which is localized it's something that other search engines like Bing they're not as good at right or if I search for a place you'll bring out Google Maps and I can look at a street view and again that's way ahead and then big Maps or Apple Maps so again many Google searches also include results from Drive Google drive or Gmail or shopping or images or videos or links to sites where passwords or payment options are saved via Chrome or Safari it would take an enormous amount of investment from any competitor to recreate this whole ecosystem so in summary can Microsoft's big significantly disrupt and take away Google's market share in the market like I said I own both stocks I love them both equally so whoever wins I will win I've got no preference but looking at the facts that being Bing is trying to gain market share by incorporating AI into their search engine now it may seems like a big deal but if you think about it so what everyone else is doing it in fact Opera have you heard of Opera operas a web browser as well opera is also now incorporating chat GPT into their web browser and of course Google is incorporating bad into their search process of course there are a few uh kings that got to work out but once they work out those kings it's going to be a Level Playing Field where now almost every search engine every browser is going to have ai infused into search so it's no longer going to become an advantage to Bing because everyone's going to have it in a couple of weeks so again I don't think that alone will give them that significant advantage over Google so for being to take significant market share from Google Now bear in mind Bing will take market share it will no doubt why because business market share is so small it's like three percent right that it's easy to take market share and Google's like 90 it's easy to lose market share so yes Google will lose our market share Bing will gain some market share that's without a doubt but will it gain significant share that it would affect Google's revenue and profits I'm not sure so leave your comments in the comment section because to do that Microsoft to significantly disrupt Google and take away great market share Bing will have to disrupt the five sources of Google's economic mode right so like I said number one uh bing will have to get people to think of Bing when they think of search and no more Google so say you're gonna build it's gonna Bing that okay number two uh bing will have to get most browsers to point to Bing as their default search engine which is going to be challenging uh because Chrome is the market leader and chrome is owned by Google so unless they can again convince Tim Cook to switch alliances number three again Bing will have to convince uh Hardware providers like Apple and Samsung to defect from Google to Bing is as their default search engine that again is not going to be that simple number four Bing will have to be able to provide high quality search results uh in order to disrupt Google now again the more people search on a search engine the more big data it has the better the search will be the more data the AI has the more it is trained the better the AI will be so in terms of that you find that Google is a huge Advantage because 84 of searches in the world go through Google and only nine percent of searches in the world go through Bing so the fact that Google does more searches will make its AI learn more and be way more advanced because it's got more data to work with so that gives it a huge Advantage now the fifth thing again is for Microsoft to compete with Google effectively they have to build also a very strong ecosystem Beyond just their search results they have to build a strong ecosystem into their search queries and match local search relevance so what do you guys think after all this research I've shared with you do you think that Microsoft Bing really has a chance to Dethrone Google as the leader in search or to take a big part of their market share or do you think that this is just a lot of uh big hyped up talk by Nutella that is all over hype and that Bing will just only maintain a small percentage of your market share I'm curious to know your thoughts leave your comments in the section below but like I said Bing will gain some market share because it's so small it has to grow right and Google because it's really got such big market share it's of course gonna lose market share slowly over time but the good news is that the search Market is growing at about 11 uh analytes so in this scenario even if Google loses market share to Bing and they lose say four percent market share every eight years which has been a trend in the last eight years and the industry is growing 11 Google's revenue and profits will still increase even as even if they lose market share small market share because the whole industry is increasing all right actually this reminds me of a lot of past examples where a new upstart company using AI was you know telling the incumbent leader that we are going to take away your market share we're gonna kill you and a very recent example was actually this company called upstart so upstart is a company that uses AI uh to do credit scoring and they work with banks to lend money to Consumers and they were claiming that they would kill FICO which is the incumbent leader so in the US most people have a FICO score that tells them their credit worthiness and with the FICO score they can get a loan from bank so again FICO has been the market leader for many many years an upstart is a new company that said using AI we are going to disrupt you and what's interesting is that you can see what happened initially there was a lot of hype and upstart which is the stock over here you can see it went up and what happened to FICO FICO people panic oh my God you're gonna get killed you're gonna get disrupted and it dropped right like what's happening to Google right now because of this uh hype but eventually you realize that it's not so simple it's not so simple for a company to unseat an incumbent leader it's not that simple and now upstart has collapsed right and you can see that FICO is now at all time times um so you ask me I think this is just a short-term uh overreaction of Google going down eventually Google's gonna go to all-time highs again and that's my my belief right um and Microsoft will go up as well so the question is can they both succeed and can my two children both do well I believe so so remember that Google has been the Monopoly for many many years a monopoly means only one player and let's say that one day Microsoft could come in and become a duopoly where they're two big leaders could they both do well yeah so if you look at it in the markets are there Industries where there are two leaders uh a duopoly and they both make money they both do really well there are many examples in fact for example I own both MasterCard and Visa it's a duopoly and either one you own you'll do really really well in fact I own both of them right because over the years both of them their share price goes up together as the industry grows how about spgi SMP Global which is a credit rating agency and moodies so I own spgi I don't own Modis but again it's a duopoly and you can see again together both of them do well so it could be the case that both Microsoft and alphabet they will continue to do well over the years so finally let's take a look at Google's chat so again like I said I already own shares of Google and I bought it many years ago so the current share price is way above my cost price but will I add more shares of Google yes I will add more shares at lower prices I'm hoping it's going to go lower again as an investor the lower it goes because of panic selling the more I like it because the more shares I can buy with the same cash I have so to me this over reaction this sound of this Panic is a great opportunity to add more shares of alphabet um so the way I look at it you can see that uh the short-term trend is still up as long as the 20 moving average the 20 EMA this red dotted line is above the 40 EMA the short-term trend is still up you can see this short-term Trend right wave up wave down wave up wave down so it's making higher highs and higher lows so we call this a short-term Trend but the longer term trend is still down it's not up yet because the 50 moving average is still below the 1 50 moving average and you can see that the 200 moving average is still sloping down so the larger trend is still down but the short-term trend is still up okay and again you can see that in the last two days it actually had this strong wave up and now it has retraced to this support level you can see this is a support level over here at about 93 dollars so what I did was um I sold cash secured put options at the 88 strike price so what that means is that if Google goes below 88 and stays there in 45 days then I'll be obligated to buy Google Shares at 88 which I don't mind because it's bloody cheap plus I received a premium by selling the put option so minus the premium you can see that my net purchase price of Google Shares or alphabet would be about 86 and this was a options alert that I send out to all my subscribers on the ultimate investors Playbook or uip Channel and something that you guys can subscribe to if you're interested go to piranaprofits.com or insights profits.com so going back to this chart like I said um you know to me I see this overreaction as an opportunity to add more shares of Google and if Google doesn't stay below 88 in 45 days if it like you know bounces back from here then I won't get to buy more shares but I'll just keep the premiums I saw on those put options and for people who don't trade options and while who want to build a position in Google for example you could build a position uh by adding shares at these support levels when they hit these support levels all right for Traders it's a different story if you're trading versus investing then yeah wait for a confirmation of a resumption of the short-term Trends you can wait for like a a bullish pin bar pattern a bullish engulfing pattern some kind of a Candlestick pattern uh before you get in for the next leg up so you have to wait for confirmation of a resumption of the trend and of course these are things we cover in our short-term swing trading course so you got to know are you entering as
